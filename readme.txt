Welcome to Chicken Joe's pizza

This website is created as a trial to the in class assessment 2 for Enterprise5203
- before I get into trying to figure out HTML5 canvas and game creation.
This project was neccessary to further develop using JS functions and classes.
Plus, an homage to my spirit animal, Chicken Joe.

For this project a Trello Kanban board is used:

This is also used as practice for understading CSS keyframes - so forgive me if there
is too much animation here!
